        For testing contrast, use a desktop tool like [Colour Contrast Analyser](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/) or an online service like [colourcontrast.cc](https://colourcontrast.cc/). The contrast ratios expected are:

        * Text versus background: `4.5:1`^
        * Non-text interface elements versus background: `3:1`

        If text is superimposed over multiple colors (such as those in a raster image) use the combination with the least contrast. Some [tools](https://www.brandwood.com/a11y/) may help with this.

        ^ Aim for 4.5:1 for all text, not just smaller/body text. This mitigates issues with thinner and less legible fonts.
