        **Instructions:** There are three tests to carry out:
        1. **Full page zoom**: For example, in Chrome, **View > Zoom** (or **Command/CTRL** and **+** by keyboard) to the maximum level. Alternatively, create a viewport that is `320px` wide and `256px` high.

        2. **Font default size**: For example, in Firefox, up the font size under **Preferences > General > Font**.
