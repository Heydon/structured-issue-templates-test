        **Instructions:** Read through the component using a screen reader. All elements, not just focusable elements, need to traversed. In Voiceover, this means holding `Control` + `Option` and using the arrow keys.

        ## No unannounced text

        Text nodes and labels visible in the interface are announced by the screen reader.

        ## No incorrect roles

        For elements that aren’t simply text nodes, an expected role is announced. Some examples:

        * An element that behaves as a button should be announced as “button”.
        * Elements organized into groups have list and list item roles. Not just bullet lists but other groups such as sets of card components.
        * On entering a major region of the page, such as the navigation or main content area, this region is identified as a landmark.
        * On focusing an input within a `<fieldset>`, the group label (usually the `<legend>`) is announced.
        * An element that is focusable has the correct role for its interactive behavior.

        ## No unannounced state changes

        When there is a change in application state that does not move focus, the screen reader user is notified of that change. For example, the content of a new status message should be announced using a live region.
